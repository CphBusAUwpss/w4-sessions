#HTTP sessions
HTTP is a "stateless" protocol which means each time a client retrieves a Web page, the client opens a separate connection to the Web server and the server automatically does not keep any record of previous client request.

Still there are following three ways to maintain session between web client and web server:  
 1. **cookies**  
 2. **hidden form fields**  
 3. **url rewriting**
